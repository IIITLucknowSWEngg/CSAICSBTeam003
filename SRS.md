# 5. Quality Indicators

## 5.1 Document Quality Metrics

To ensure the SRS document is complete and clear, the following quality metrics will be applied:

- **Imperative Statements**: Use terms like "must" and "shall" for essential requirements to avoid ambiguity. For instance, "Users must be able to upload a profile image" clearly denotes a mandatory feature.
- **Consistency**: Ensure terminology is consistent throughout the document. Terms like "user," "admin," "profile," and "job" will have a uniform definition and application.
- **Clarity**: Every functional and non-functional requirement must be unambiguous. Use plain, concise language to make the document accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- **Traceability**: Each requirement will be uniquely identified with a code (e.g., FR-1, NFR-1) to ensure traceability during development and testing. This allows for easy tracking of each requirement’s implementation and verification.
- **Completeness**: The SRS will cover all functional, non-functional, external interface, and system requirements comprehensively, including detailed use cases and system constraints.
- **Prioritization**: Critical requirements will be prioritized, allowing the development team to focus on high-impact features (e.g., security and scalability) first.

## 5.2 Validation and Verification

- **Validation**: The system must align with business goals and user needs. To validate this:
  - Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with a sample group of end users (professionals, recruiters, and companies).
  - Perform stakeholder reviews to ensure the platform aligns with the business’s vision and addresses end-user requirements.

- **Verification**: To verify that the system meets all specifications, the following methods will be used:
  - **Unit Testing**: Each module will be individually tested to ensure it functions as expected.
  - **Integration Testing**: Modules will be tested together to ensure smooth interaction between different components (e.g., profile management and job application systems).
  - **System Testing**: The entire system will be tested in the production-like environment to ensure all components are functioning correctly.
  - **Performance Testing**: The platform will undergo stress tests to simulate real-world scenarios, such as handling high volumes of concurrent users or job searches.
