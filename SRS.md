# 5. Quality Indicators

## 5.1 Document Quality Metrics

To ensure the SRS document is complete and clear, the following quality metrics will be applied:

- **Imperative Statements**: Use terms like "must" and "shall" for essential requirements to avoid ambiguity. For instance, "Users must be able to upload a profile image" clearly denotes a mandatory feature.
- **Consistency**: Ensure terminology is consistent throughout the document. Terms like "user," "admin," "profile," and "job" will have a uniform definition and application.
- **Clarity**: Every functional and non-functional requirement must be unambiguous. Use plain, concise language to make the document accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- **Traceability**: Each requirement will be uniquely identified with a code (e.g., FR-1, NFR-1) to ensure traceability during development and testing. This allows for easy tracking of each requirement’s implementation and verification.
- **Completeness**: The SRS will cover all functional, non-functional, external interface, and system requirements comprehensively, including detailed use cases and system constraints.
