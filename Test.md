### **Test Case 8: Load Handling for 500,000 Concurrent Users**
**Scenario**: The system should support up to 500,000 concurrent users.

**Test Steps**:  
1. Use a load-testing tool like **Apache JMeter**, **k6**, or cloud-based solutions to simulate **500,000 concurrent users**.  
2. Execute critical workflows:  
   - User Sign Up.  
   - Job search and posting.  
   - Messaging.  
3. Monitor system performance:  
   - Measure response times, CPU, memory, and database utilization.  
4. Verify response times do not degrade beyond acceptable thresholds.  

**Expected Result**:  
- The system successfully handles 500,000 concurrent users.  
- Critical workflows (like job search) maintain acceptable response times (< 1 second).  

**Test Code Example using k6**:
```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '5m', target: 500000 }, // Ramp up to 500,000 users
    { duration: '10m', target: 500000 }, // Sustain for 10 minutes
    { duration: '2m', target: 0 },      // Ramp down
  ],
};

export default function () {
  let res = http.get('https://linkedin-clone.com/api/job-search?q=developer');
  
  // Verify response time
  check(res, {
    'Response time is below 1s': (r) => r.timings.duration < 1000,
    'Status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
  });
  sleep(1); // Simulate user wait time
}
```

---

### **Test Case 9: Job Postings and Search Response Time**
**Scenario**: Job postings and search results should load within **1 second** under standard conditions.

**Test Steps**:  
1. Navigate to the job search or posting page.  
2. Trigger a job search query with a commonly used keyword (e.g., "developer").  
3. Record the response time of the search results.  
4. Verify the response time is under 1 second.  

**Expected Result**:  
The job postings or search results load in **< 1 second**.  

**Test Code Example**:
```javascript
describe('Job Search Performance', function() {
  it('should load job search results within 1 second', async function() {
    const startTime = Date.now();
    
    // Step 2: Trigger job search
    const response = await jobSearchPage.searchJobs('developer');
    
    const duration = Date.now() - startTime;

    // Step 4: Verify response time
    expect(response.status).to.equal(200);
    expect(duration).to.be.lessThan(1000); // 1 second
  });
});
```

---

### **Test Case 10: User Session Expiry After Inactivity**
**Scenario**: User sessions must expire after a period of inactivity for security purposes.

**Test Steps**:  
1. Log in to the LinkedIn Clone platform.  
2. Perform some activity to validate the session.  
3. Remain **inactive for 15 minutes** (or the configured timeout).  
4. Attempt to perform an action (e.g., navigate to a protected page).  
5. Verify that the session has expired and the user is redirected to the login page.  

**Expected Result**:  
- The user session expires after 15 minutes of inactivity.  
- The user is redirected to the login page when performing further actions.  

**Test Code Example**:
```javascript
describe('User Session Expiry', function() {
  it('should log out the user after 15 minutes of inactivity', function() {
    loginPage.login('john.doe@example.com', 'password123');

    // Simulate inactivity
    browser.pause(15 * 60 * 1000); // 15 minutes in milliseconds

    // Attempt to access dashboard
    dashboardPage.navigate();

    // Verify user is redirected to login page
    expect(loginPage.isDisplayed()).to.be.true;
    expect(loginPage.getMessage()).to.include('Your session has expired. Please log in again.');
  });
});
```

---

### **Test Case 11: GDPR Compliance - Right to be Forgotten**
**Scenario**: Ensure GDPR compliance by allowing users to delete their data.

**Test Steps**:  
1. Log in to the LinkedIn Clone platform.  
2. Navigate to the **Profile Settings** page.  
3. Request data deletion (e.g., "Delete My Account").  
4. Confirm the deletion request via email/OTP verification.  
5. Verify the account and all associated data are deleted from the system.  
6. Attempt to log in with the deleted account credentials.  
7. Verify login fails and account no longer exists.  

**Expected Result**:  
- User can request and confirm account deletion.  
- All personal data is permanently removed.  
- Login attempts with deleted credentials fail.  

**Test Code Example**:
```javascript
describe('GDPR Compliance - Right to be Forgotten', function() {
  it('should allow user to delete their account and data', async function() {
    profilePage.openSettings();
    profilePage.requestAccountDeletion();

    // Step 4: Confirm via OTP/email
    const confirmationCode = emailService.getLatestOTP('john.doe@example.com');
    profilePage.confirmDeletion(confirmationCode);

    // Verify deletion success
    expect(profilePage.getSuccessMessage()).to.include('Your account has been deleted');

    // Step 6: Attempt to log in
    loginPage.login('john.doe@example.com', 'password123');

    // Verify login fails
    expect(loginPage.getErrorMessage()).to.include('Account not found');
  });
});
```
