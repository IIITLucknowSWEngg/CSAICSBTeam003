# Interview Transcript for LinkedIn Clone v1.0

## Interview 1: Job Seeker - Recent Graduate A

**Interviewer:** “Tell us about your experience with professional networking platforms. What do you think works well, and what could be improved?”

**Recent Graduate A:**  
“Well, as a recent graduate, I’m mostly looking for a platform that helps me create a strong profile to show off my skills, internships, and certifications. Most platforms are pretty straightforward when it comes to profile setup, but they often feel too complex for someone just starting out. I want to be able to build a profile in a few steps without getting lost in the process. The option to upload a resume quickly would also be helpful, so I don’t have to keep filling in the same details multiple times.”

**Interviewer:** “What type of job search features would help you the most?”

**Recent Graduate A:**  
“I’d love advanced filters to help narrow down job searches. I’m specifically looking for entry-level roles, so things like location, job type (full-time/part-time), industry, and salary range are really important. Also, I think notifications for jobs that match my skills would be very helpful. I don’t want to miss any opportunities because I didn’t notice a posting.”

**Interviewer:** “How would you like to apply for jobs?”

**Recent Graduate A:**  
“I’d appreciate a ‘one-click’ apply feature—just upload my resume once, and then I can apply to multiple jobs quickly without having to upload the same document repeatedly. It would also be useful to track the status of my applications. Sometimes, you apply to many places, and it’s hard to remember where you stand in the process.”

**Interviewer:** “What kind of profile visibility settings would you prefer?”

**Recent Graduate A:**  
“I think I’d prefer my profile to be public so recruiters can easily find me, but I’d like to control who sees my detailed work history. For instance, I could have the basic info visible to everyone but make my detailed work experience or recommendations visible only to my connections or recruiters.”

## Interview 2: Job Seeker - Experienced Professional B

**Interviewer:** “As an experienced professional, what would make your experience on a professional networking platform more effective?”

**Experienced Professional B:**  
“I need to streamline the application process. I’ve been through this process many times, so anything that reduces friction is a win. I want to apply for jobs quickly, and I don’t want to upload my resume every time I find a job listing. It should automatically pull in my details based on my profile or previous applications.”

**Interviewer:** “How would you like the job search and application management features to work?”

**Experienced Professional B:**  
“The search filters should allow me to focus on mid-senior roles with more specific criteria, like salary range, job type (e.g., remote or in-office), and location. Additionally, tracking applications is essential. I’d like a dashboard that shows me where I am in each process—whether my application is under review, shortlisted, or closed.”

**Interviewer:** “What features would help make your profile stand out to recruiters?”

**Experienced Professional B:**  
“I think endorsements and recommendations are key. A colleague or boss endorsing a specific skill or giving a recommendation can add a lot of weight. Also, I would appreciate privacy controls. I don’t want my profile to be public if I’m not actively looking, but I want it visible to recruiters if I decide to start searching.”

**Interviewer:** “How would you use the platform to network or stay connected with peers?”

**Experienced Professional B:**  
“Being able to stay in touch with colleagues and industry professionals is important, but I don’t always need to be connected with everyone I follow. I’d prefer to follow people or companies for updates, but not have to send a connection request every time. I’d also like suggestions for people to connect with based on mutual industry contacts.”

## Interview 3: Recruiter - Recruiter X

**Interviewer:** “What would make your recruitment process more efficient on a platform like this?”

**Recruiter X:**  
“As a recruiter, speed and efficiency are crucial. I need to be able to post job openings quickly and manage them in one place. I also need a way to filter candidates based on specific qualifications. So, I need advanced search filters that allow me to sift through resumes by skills, experience, and education levels. Ideally, these filters should be customizable for each job posting.”

**Interviewer:** “How important are insights and analytics in the recruitment process?”

**Recruiter X:**  
“Insights are extremely important. I want to know how many candidates have viewed a job post, how many applied, and even track trends like which skills are most in demand. With this data, I can refine my future postings and improve my recruitment strategies.”

**Interviewer:** “How would you like to manage candidates once they’ve applied?”

**Recruiter X:**  
“I’d like a way to review all applicants in one place, sort them by skill or experience, and keep track of where they are in the process—whether they’ve been shortlisted, interviewed, or rejected. If I could add notes to candidates and see their profile activity, that would also help.”

**Interviewer:** “Would you prefer any automation in the hiring process?”

**Recruiter X:**  
“Yes, a bit of automation could help with initial screening. For example, using AI to flag applicants that don’t meet the basic criteria would save a lot of time. However, human intervention is still essential for a more personalized review, so the process should allow for both.”

## Interview 4: Employer - Small Business Owner C

**Interviewer:** “As a small business owner, what role do you see a company profile playing in your recruitment strategy?”

**Small Business Owner C:**  
“For a small company, a strong brand presence is critical to attracting top talent. I need a company page where I can highlight who we are, our achievements, and our work culture. This is important for building trust and attracting candidates who are a good cultural fit.”

**Interviewer:** “What features would you want on your company’s profile page?”

**Small Business Owner C:**  
“We need customizable branding elements—things like our logo, company values, and maybe a video about the team or office culture. Also, I’d like to be able to post job openings directly on the page, and ideally, applicants should be able to apply directly through that post.”

**Interviewer:** “How important is it for you to track engagement with your job postings?”

**Small Business Owner C:**  
“Very important. If we see that a job post isn’t getting enough views, we can adjust the description or maybe boost it to reach a larger audience. Insights on who’s viewed the post and whether they’ve followed the company page would also help gauge interest in our brand.”

**Interviewer:** “Would you use analytics for other purposes besides recruitment?”

**Small Business Owner C:**  
“Yes, definitely. Engagement analytics for our posts could help us understand what content resonates with our followers. It could also help in marketing efforts, so we can figure out what kinds of content attract not just job seekers, but potential clients and partners as well.”

## Interview 5: Platform Moderator - Administrator E

**Interviewer:** “What are your top priorities when it comes to content moderation?”

**Platform Moderator E:**  
“I need a system that helps me identify inappropriate content quickly. An AI-driven system that flags potentially harmful posts based on keywords and user reports would be ideal. But not everything can be flagged by AI, so there should be an easy way for me to review flagged content manually.”

**Interviewer:** “How would you manage user reports?”

**Platform Moderator E:**  
“We need a dashboard where I can see all the flagged content in one place, along with the context—who reported it, when, and why. If a user reports a post, I want to see their comments and the post itself. This will help me make a more informed decision about whether it violates platform policies.”

**Interviewer:** “How should content moderation balance automation and human review?”

**Platform Moderator E:**  
“AI tools should handle the bulk of the work—flagging content for things like hate speech or explicit content. However, for more subjective issues, like potential harassment or nuanced cases, human review is necessary. Automation should provide recommendations, but humans should make the final call.”

## Interview 6: Privacy Advocate H

**Interviewer:** “What privacy features do you consider crucial for a platform like this?”

**Privacy Advocate H:**  
“User data security is non-negotiable. I expect all sensitive information to be encrypted—passwords, personal data, everything. There should also be clear consent mechanisms for sharing personal information. The platform should comply with GDPR and other privacy regulations, and users should have control over what data is shared and with whom.”

**Interviewer:** “What other security features would you want to see?”

**Privacy Advocate H:**  
“I’d want two-factor authentication (2FA) as an option for all accounts, and it should be the default for anything involving sensitive information. Users should also be able to delete their accounts and request that their data be permanently removed from the platform.”

**Interviewer:** “How important is user consent in data handling?”

**Privacy Advocate H:**  
“Very important. Users should be able to opt-in to how their data is used, and they should have a clear understanding of what their consent means. The platform should provide a transparent privacy policy and allow users to change their consent preferences easily.”
