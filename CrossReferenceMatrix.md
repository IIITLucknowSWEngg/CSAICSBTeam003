# Cross Reference Matrix for LinkedIn Clone Project

This matrix links the test cases with the corresponding features and requirements. It ensures that all features have been properly tested, and that test coverage aligns with the business and functional requirements of the LinkedIn clone.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to map the test cases to the features and corresponding requirements for the LinkedIn clone. This helps ensure that every requirement is covered by one or more test cases, enabling thorough testing and validation of the system.

---

## Legend

- **Test ID**: Unique identifier for each test case.
- **Feature**: The feature of the system being tested.
- **Test Case ID**: Unique identifier for each test case related to the feature.
- **Reference Requirement**: The requirement that this test case verifies or validates.
- **Test Status**: (To be updated after testing) - `Pass`, `Fail`, `Pending`, or `Not Applicable (N/A)`.

## Notes

- **Test Status Updates**: This matrix should be updated as test cases are executed and their status is determined (e.g., Pass, Fail).
- **Versioning**: Make sure the test cases align with any changes in the features or requirements.
- **Continuous Updates**: As the project progresses, any new test cases or requirements should be added to this matrix.

## Conclusion

The Cross Reference Matrix ensures full coverage of the requirements and features in the LinkedIn clone project. By mapping the test cases to their corresponding requirements, we can validate that the application meets both functional and non-functional expectations.
